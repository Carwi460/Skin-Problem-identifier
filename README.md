# Skin-Problem-identifier
Final project - AI Course

## Summary
The aim of this project is for everyone to have a reliable and easily accessable skin problem identifier in their phone. To be able to identify the patients diagnosis, the application would used convolutional neural networks as well as deep learning to be able to classify the images provided by the user.

## Background
This idea would provide the user with an instant feedback without having to go to the doctors office. When you find out what your skin problem is, you can decide for yourself if you should see a doctor or not, rather then going to the doctor's office when you did not really had to in the first place. 

## How is it used?
The application is used by taking a photo of you current skin problem an uploading it to our server. The AI will then, by using an image classifier, get back to you with the name of your potential problem. This app could be used at any time, everywhere, by anyone. 

## Data sources and AI methods
The information will be collected from sites like the one below and the users.

## Challenges
Challenges with this project would be to make sure that the user uploades pictures that are clear enough to be able to differentiate one problem from another. Another challenge would be to initially train the network to deliver reliable results. 

## What next?
Next up would be to add a treatment recommenation to the user.
